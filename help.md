1. Write the **siteId number** of the NeotomaDB site of your interest and 
click **Search**.    
As this is a demo app, not all the siteIds are available. 
Here there are some siteIds that will work: 9606, 8578, 30463, 10344.
  
2. Click on the **HYDROlakeDB lake polygon** (blue polygons)
that can replace the NeotomaDB site polygon/point. 
The information about the HYDROlake will be displayed in the right panel.
  
3. Take a decision regarding the site and submit it.
You can: 
   - Keep the NeotomaDB site polygon as it is,  
   - Replace it with a HYDROlakeDB polygon or,  
   - Create your own polygon.
