## Persona A: Santiago, a Neotoma Data Steward

Santiago is a Neotoma data steward. He has significant experience with Neotoma, uploading records directly using the Tilia software package. He understands the data structure of Neotoma (sites, datasets, collection units) and works primarily with freshwater diatoms. Santiago works with Neotoma primarly through Tilia and Explorer, but is beginning to work with the new `neotoma2` R package.

For a research project, Santiago is interested in building a statistical model that looks at a sequence of surface samples, and relates these to environmental factors as well as lake parameters. To do this, he needs to ensure that all sites in his study region have clear information about the lake parameters provided for the sites.

To do this work Santiago wants to:

* Find sites by name or by spatial domain.
* Look at the reported location of the site as described by Neotoma.
* Know whether someone has already edited or made adjustments to the site.
* Validate the site with the site description, map overview and the publication (if provided in the dataset metadata).
* Obtain metadata from the HydroLakes database and assign it to the site
* If the site is not associated with an existing HydroLakes site, allow Santiago to add a "correct" polygon for the lake perimeter.

## Persona B: Jayla, an undergraduate student involved in a Work Experience initiative

Jayla is an undergraduate student working in a paleoecology lab. As part of her time in the lab she is helping gradute students with their projects, but has some spare time to do other work. Although not assigned to a specific project, she'd like to simply log in and update some sites at random. Although she's doing this for fun, she'd like her work recognized as a contribution to the Neotoma ecosystem.

To do this, Jayla wants to:

* Find sites by searching a region, or select a random site.
* Have her identity recorded and _reported_ through the application.
