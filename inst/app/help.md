1. Write the **siteId number** of the NeotomaDB site of your interest and 
click **Search**.    
As this is a demo app, not all the siteIds are available. 
Here there are some siteIds that will work: 9606, 8578, 30463, 10344.
  
2. Click on the HYDROlakeDB lake (blue polygons) you consider can replace 
the NeotomaDB site polygon/point. The information about the lake will be 
displayed in the right panel.
  
3. Take a decision regarding the site and submit it. You can: 

i - Keep the NeotomaDB site polygon as it is,  
  
ii - Replace it with a HYDROlakeDB polygon or,  
  
iii - Create your own polygon.
